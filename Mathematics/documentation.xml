      <remarks>
        Perlin noise is a coherent, pseudo-random noise source developed by Ken Perlin in the 1980s. It won him an
        academy award, as the technique quickly became ubiquitous in the generation of all kinds of procedural textures
        for use in computer graphics. Perlin noise has some minor flaws, however. These include computational
        complexity that increases exponentially with the number of dimensions and minor directional artifacts due to
        its anisotropy. These have been mostly rectified by the creation of Simplex noise, which is also implemented
        in this class. This class implements the improvements to Perlin noise that Ken Perlin published in 2002,
        which eliminate some of the artifacts.

    <AboutSimplex>
      <remarks>
        Simplex noise is a coherent, pseudo-random noise source developed by Ken Perlin in 2001 to address the flaws in
        his earlier Perlin noise algorithm. Simplex noise is substantially faster than Perlin noise above 3 dimensions,
        is visually isotropic, and is easy to implement in hardware. It can be used for the same tasks to which Perlin
        noise is typically applied.

        This method cannot always achieve full 107-bit precision, but comes close. The results are more accurate when
        the power is an integer. With integer powers, the relative error ranges from 0 to 4.39e-31. With non-integer powers,
        the relative error ranges from about 0 to 2.8e-30, but is usually at least 5e-33.

        This method cannot always achieve full 107-bit precision, although it is close. The relative error is typically around 1e-32, but
        ranges from 0 to 6e-31 through most of the range, and is usually at least 5e-33. With values near the extremes of the range (above
        1e300 or so in magnitude), the relative error may rise to about 5e-27 or more.

        <para>
          This method has a small bias that allows it to produce exact results for powers of 10 from 10^-300 to 10^300, but which
          causes some values very close to powers of 10 to be treated as though they were powers of 10. This bias is small, however; for
          integer values, the first incorrect value to produce the wrong result because of the bias is near 10^29, so the relative error
          introduced by the bias is about 1e-29, and then only for values similarly close to powers of 10.

        This method supports the standard numeric format strings suitable for use with floating point numbers, which are "C", "D", "E",
        "F", "G", "N", "P", and "R", including precision specifiers (such as "F6"). In addition, this method supports the "X" format, which
        is a hexadecimal representation that allows fast, exact conversions to and from string. The method also supports an "S" format
        that returns the individual components, simplifying the creation of constants in source code. (If one component is returned,
        it is an exact double-precision value that can be used to initialize a new <see cref="FP107"/> value. If two components are
        returned, they can be passed to the <see cref="FromComponents"/> method to reconstruct the original value.)
        Custom format strings are not currently supported.
        <note type="caution">
          Although the "R" (round-trip) mode outputs with full precision, the <see cref="FP107.Parse(string)"/> method can only
          guarantee 107 bits of precision on input, so values that have effective mantissas larger than 107 bits will not round-trip if you
          use the built-in parser to parse them, even when using the "R" format string. If you want to guarantee perfect round-tripping
          with the built-in parser, use the "X" (hexadecimal) mode.

  <Integer>
    <BitwiseOps>
      <remarks>
        <note type="caution">
          This method performs a bitwise operation. This works as expected for positive operands, however negative operands are different.
          In normal fixed-size integers (such as int and long) negative values are stored in two's complement form on most machines. This
          means that <c>-x == ~((unsigned)x-1)</c>. Two's complement form is one way to conveniently represent positive and negative
          numbers in a fixed-size integer on a CPU. For an arbitrarily sized integer type such as this, two's complement is unnecessary.
          However, bitwise operations depend on the precise bits stored in the value, so for consistency with fixed-size integers this
          method will emulate two's complement for negative values. This may result in a substantial performance decrease and an unexpected
          result. If you wish to avoid this behavior, only perform bitwise operations on non-negative integers.
        </note>
      </remarks>
    </BitwiseOps>
    <UnsafeOps>
      <remarks>
        <note type="caution">
          This method is unsafe. <see cref="Integer"/> values can share storage with each other. Operations between two Integers may result
          in new Integer that shares storage with one or both of the operands. For instance, <c>a = b</c> or <c>a | b</c> or
          <c>a &amp; b</c> or <c>a + b</c> or others may result in a new value that shares internal storage with <c>a</c> or <c>b</c>, even
          if the result doesn't have the same value as either <c>a</c> or <c>b</c>. (Storage may be shared if they have the same magnitude,
          regardless of sign.) Since Integer values are immutable for all normal operations, this improves performance. However, if an
          unsafe method is invoked, it may mutate the integer in-place without allocating new storage. This can greatly improve performance
          in some cases, but if the integer shares storage with other values, the other values may become corrupted.
          <para>
            To use unsafe methods properly, first make sure that the integer does not share storage with other values. You can do this by
            not setting the value based on other <see cref="Integer"/> values and not setting other values based on it. For instance, it's
            safe to perform unsafe operations on an Integer initialized from a non-Integer value such as an int literal. As an exception,
            it's also safe to perform unsafe operations on values initialized using <see cref="One"/>, <see cref="MinusOne"/>, or
            <see cref="Zero"/>. Alternately, you can call <see cref="Clone"/> to obtain an Integer that is guaranteed not to share storage
            with any other values. Just be careful not to reintroduce sharing, as in the following:
            <c>a = a.Clone(); a.UnsafeIncrement(); ... b *= a; ... a.UnsafeIncrement();</c> In the example, <c>a</c> is cloned, allowing
            unsafe operations upon it. But then it is used to reassign <c>b</c>, potentially causing <c>b</c> to share storage with
            <c>a</c>. Then a later unsafe operation upon <c>a</c> can corrupt <c>b</c>. If you really want to walk a fine line, you can mix
            unsafe operations with normal operations as long as you can guarantee that the normal operations do not cause sharing, i.e.
            that the result will not have a magnitude equal to any operand. In the example above, <c>b *= a</c> would be safe if you know
            that neither operand equals 1 or -1. (Zero values never share internal storage.)
          </para>
          <para>Finally, don't rely on unsafe operations to do the operation in-place. Sometimes they may have to allocate new storage.</para>

          A special property of the QR decomposition is that the coefficient matrix A can be efficiently updated to a new
          coefficient matrix equal to A + (s ⊗ t) where s and t are vectors and ⊗ is the tensor product. (This is related to the
          Sherman-Morrison formula for updating the matrix inverse of a matrix M given an update to M of the form M = M + (a ⊗ b).)
          This method performs that update indirectly. Given that A = Q*R, we have A + (s ⊗ t) = Q*(R + (u ⊗ v)), where t = v and
          s = Q*u (or u = transpose(Q)*s).

            An MxN matrix A transforms an N-dimensional vector into an M-dimensional vector. That is, it represents a transformation
            from N-dimensional space to M-dimensional space. However, sometimes the transformation only maps to a subspace of M. This is
            always true, for instance, when N &lt; M. Singular value decomposition decomposes A into two column-orthogonal matrices,
            commonly denoted U and V (each of width N), a subset of whose columns represent orthonormal basis vectors of the range and null
            space of the matrix, respectively. The range of A describes the subspace of M-dimensional space mapped to by the
            transformation, while the null space describes the subset of N-dimensional space that is mapped to zero in M-dimensional space.
            The dimension of A's range is known as A's rank, and the dimension of A's null space is known as A's nullity.
          </para>
          <para>
            In addition to U and V, singular value decomposition produces the singular values of A. (Technically, the singular values are
            the square roots of the eigenvalues of transpose(A) * A, and also of A * transpose(A).) Geometrically, the matrix A transforms an
            N-dimensional unit sphere into an M-dimensional ellipsoid, and the non-zero singular values are the lengths of the ellipsoid's
            semi-axes. Practically, singular values are rarely exactly zero with numerical methods, given roundoff error, so we treat very
            small singular values (less than a given fraction of the largest singular value) as though they were zero.
          </para>
          <para>
            The singular values provide a number of things. First, they determine which columns of U and V are part of the matrix's range
            and null space, respectively. Columns in U whose corresponding singular value is non-zero (in practice, above a threshold) form the
            basis of the range, while columns in V whose corresponding singular values are zero (in practice, very small) form the basis of the
            null space.
            The singular values also provide a measure of how singular a matrix is. The so-called condition number of a matrix is the ratio of
            the largest singular value to the smallest. If infinite (i.e. if a singular value is zero), the matrix is singular (degenerate).
            If very large, the matrix is ill-conditioned. The condition number roughly corresponds to how much the solution to the matrix
            changes with a change in right-hand side values, so with a large condition number, a small error in right-hand side values will
            become a large error in the solution. Also, roundoff error can be multiplied by the condition number.

      <NullSpaceRemarks>
        <remarks>
          As mentioned above, the null space of a matrix represents the subset of N-dimensional space that is mapped to zero in
          M-dimensional space, and the nullity of a matrix is the dimension of its null space.
          If a matrix representing a set of linear equations has a unique solution, then the null space contains only
          the zero vector. That is to say that only the zero vector in N-space becomes a zero vector in M-space. In general, the set of
          solutions can be found using the description of the space returned from <see cref="GetNullSpace" />. The set of solutions is
          any solution vector plus any linear combination of the column vectors of the null space. You can use <see cref="Solve" /> to
          retrieve an initial solution vector from which the other solutions can be generated. (If the null space is empty, then that
          solution is unique.)

        <remarks>
          As mentioned above, the range of a matrix represents the subset of M-dimensional space that is mapped to by the transformation
          represented by the matrix, and the rank of a matrix is the dimension of its range.
          The range of the decomposed matrix is set of M-dimensional points (vectors) formed by the addition of
          any linear combination of the column vectors of the matrix returned by <see cref="GetRange" />.

      <SolveRemarks>
        <remarks>
          When using singular value decomposition to solve a system of linear equations, there are three main cases to consider. First,
          when the linear system has a single solution, single value decomposition (SVD) will find it. When the system has no solution, SVD
          will produce the closest vector to a solution in the least squares sense. When the system has an infinite number of solutions,
          SVD will produce the smallest solution vector, which can be used with <see cref="GetNullSpace"/> to generate any of the other
          solutions. This implementation of SVD can only do in-place solving when the solution matrix has the same height as the width of
          the decomposed matrix, or the solution matrix has a width of 1. In other situations, it will return a new matrix, even if you
          requested in-place solving.

          Note that if <see cref="ConstraintEnforcement"/> is set to a penalty method, the objective function may be invoked with
          parameter values that don't satisfy the constraints. It should not throw an exception in that case. If possible, the behavior of
          the function outside the bounds of the constraints should be smooth, to allow the search to easily traverse the topography of the
          function back into the feasible region. However, if the objective function is meaningless outside its bounds, an appropriate
          behavior is to return <see cref="double.NaN"/> and/or to set <see cref="ConstraintEnforcement"/> to use a barrier method rather
          than a penalty method.

        <remarks>
          This method works by dividing the interval into a number of equal-sized subintervals. Within each subinterval, it takes the
          function value at the two edges and at the midpoint. If the midpoint is lower than the edges, then the subinterval brackets a
          minimum and is returned. Otherwise, the method assumes that the function's local behavior can be approximated by a quadratic
          form, fits a parabola to the three known points, and examines the function's value at the minimum of the parabola. Again, if the
          function's value there is less than the edges, then the subinterval brackets a minimum and is returned. This method may fail if
          the local behavior of the function within the subinterval cannot be approximated well by a quadratic form. For well-behaved
          functions, using smaller subintervals (by increasing the number of segments) can usually give better results.

        This function converges quadratically on the root, making it a very effective method. It also tends to be quite accurate.
        However, it is vulnerable to pathological cases in which it can fail to find a root even when it exists. Newton-Raphson is also
        quite sensitive in requiring the initial guess to be fairly close to the root. In difficult cases, it may be better to use
        <see cref="Brent">Brent's method</see>, or even the <see cref="Subdivide">the subdivision method</see>. This implementation of
        Newton's method brackets the root within an interval to avoid shortcomings in the standard Newton's method that cause it to diverge
        wildly if it encounters a derivative near zero. Because of the bracketing, the method generally cannot find double roots. If you
        need to find a double root, you may try <see cref="UnboundedNewtonRaphson" />.
