        Perlin noise is a coherent, pseudo-random noise source developed by Ken Perlin in the 1980s. It won him an
        academy award, as the technique quickly became ubiquitous in the generation of all kinds of procedural textures
        for use in computer graphics. Perlin noise has some minor flaws, however. These include computational
        complexity that increases exponentially with the number of dimensions and minor directional artifacts due to
        its anisotropy. These have been mostly rectified by the creation of Simplex noise, which is also implemented
        in this class. Note that this class implements the improvements to Perlin noise that Ken Perlin published in
        2002, which eliminate several artifacts.

      <remarks>
        Simplex noise was coherent, pseudo-random noise source developed by Ken Perlin in 2001 to address the flaws in
        his earlier Perlin noise algorithm. Simplex noise is substantially faster than Perlin noise above 3 dimensions,
        is visually isotropic, and is easy to implement in hardware. It can be used for the same tasks to which Perlin
        noise is typically applied.
