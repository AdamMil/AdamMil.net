    <AboutPerlin>
      <remarks>
        Perlin noise is a coherent, pseudo-random noise source developed by Ken Perlin in the 1980s. It won him an
        academy award, as the technique quickly became ubiquitous in the generation of all kinds of procedural textures
        for use in computer graphics. Perlin noise has some minor flaws, however. These include computational
        complexity that increases exponentially with the number of dimensions and minor directional artifacts due to
        its anisotropy. These have been mostly rectified by the creation of Simplex noise, which is also implemented
        in this class. Note that this class implements the improvements to Perlin noise that Ken Perlin published in
        2002, which eliminate several artifacts.

    <AboutSimplex>
      <remarks>
        Simplex noise is a coherent, pseudo-random noise source developed by Ken Perlin in 2001 to address the flaws in
        his earlier Perlin noise algorithm. Simplex noise is substantially faster than Perlin noise above 3 dimensions,
        is visually isotropic, and is easy to implement in hardware. It can be used for the same tasks to which Perlin
        noise is typically applied.

        <summary>This method returns the angle between two points.</summary>
        <param name="start">The first point.</param>

      <returns>
        A matrix of the same size as <paramref name="values" /> where each column contains a solution to the system of equations (using

      <remarks>
        As an example, to solve the following set of equations:
        <code>
          4x + 2y - 2z = 10
          2x + 8y + 4z = 32
          30x + 12y - 4z = 24
        </code>
        You would construct the following coefficients matrix:
        <code>
           4  2 -2
           2  8  4
          30 12 -4
        </code>
        And the following values matrix:
        <code>
          10
          32
          24
        </code>
        The method would return a matrix containing the solution:
        <code>
          -2
           6
          -3
