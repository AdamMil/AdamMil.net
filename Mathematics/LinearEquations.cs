      // this is the most basic form of Gauss-Jordan elimination: say we have the following equations:
      // 2x + 3y + 4z = 20
      // 3x + 4y + 5z = 26
      //  x - 2y + 2z = 3
      //
      // then we have coefficient and value matrices, called "a" and "b" here, of:
      // | 2  3  4 |         | 20 |
      // | 3  4  5 |   and   | 26 |
      // | 1 -2  2 |         |  3 |
      //
      // now we iterate over the columns. for column i, we:
      //   1. divide the entire row i in both matrices by a_ii
      //   2. for each other row k, then subtract row i times a_ki from row k. this results in a_ki becoming zero
      //   as a result, the column i has a 1 in row i and zeros in all other rows. this matches the form of an identity matrix for that
      //   column
      // after iterating over all columns, the coefficients matrix is changed into an identity matrix and the values matrix contains the
      // solutions. applied to the matrices above, we would do the following in the first iteration:
      //   * divide the first row by a_00 (which is 2), producing:  | 1 3/2 2 |  and  | 10 |
      //   * subtract 3 * row 0 from row 1 and 1 * row 0 from row 2
      //     | 1  3/2  2 |         | 10 |
      //     | 0 -1/2 -1 |   and   | -4 |
      //     | 0 -7/2  0 |         | -7 |
      // the other two iterations produce:
      //   | 1  0  -1 |         | -2 |                | 1  0  0 |   and   | 1 |
      //   | 0  1   2 |   and   |  8 |    and then    | 0  1  0 |   and   | 2 |
      //   | 0  0   7 |         | 21 |                | 0  0  1 |   and   | 3 |
      // so x=1, y=2, and z=3.
      //
      // it's useful to generate the inverse of the coefficient matrix at the same time. this can be done by adding a third matrix of the
      // same size as the coefficients matrix, initially containing an identity matrix, which is treated exactly like the values matrix. as
      // the algorithm progresses, the coefficients matrix will transform into the identity matrix and the identity matrix will transform
      // into the inverse matrix. in fact, since for each corresponding element of the two matrices, one of them will predictably be either
      // a 0 or 1, we don't need a separate matrix but can mutate the coefficient matrix into its inverse rather than mutating it into the
      // identity matrix
      // 
      // now it happens to be the case that this basic form of the algorithm is numerically unstable due to rounding error. therefore the
      // concept of "pivoting" is added to stabilize it. (pivoting is also needed to avoid division by zero in the case of zero entries on
      // the diagonal.) pivoting is essentially finding the best value to divide by in each iteration and swapping rows and columns of the
      // matrix to place that value at a_ii. to avoid messing up the part of the matrix that we've already processed (and converted into
      // identity form), we can choose from any value to the right of and below a_ii (or a_ii itself). swapping rows has no effect on the
      // solution, but swapping columns does, so column swaps have to be reversed at the end. the criteria for choosing the best value to
      // divide by remain undiscovered, but it works well in practice to divide by the coefficient having the largest magnitude. (this
      // makes the behavior dependent on the original scaling of the equations, which may be undesirable in some rare cases, but that is
      // not addressed in this implementation.)

      // equations and put them on more equal footing -- useful since the partial pivot search is much more limited in scope than a full
      // pivot search). the result is not a rowwise permutation of the decomposition, but the decomposition of a rowwise permutation of A.

      // look above at the discussion of Gauss-Jordan elimination. imagine if instead of transforming the coefficient matrix into the
      // identity matrix, we only subtracted from the portion of the matrix below the diagonal. we would wind up with a partially
      // transformed upper triangular matrix and a partially solved value matrix:
      //
      //      | a b c |         | p |               | x |
      // A' = | 0 d e |    B' = | q |   (where A' * | y | = B')
      //      | 0 0 f |         | r |               | z |
      //
      // Given this, it's actually quite simple to complete the solution. The x, y, z vector above contains the unknowns. Because only one
      // element in the bottom row of A' is non-zero, we can solve for z immediately: z = r/f. (Because in the matrix multiplication,
      // r = 0*x + 0*y + f*z = f*z.) With z solved, we move onto y. Because q = 0*x + d*y + e*z = d*y + e*z, we can substitute r/f for z
      // and get q = d*y + e*r/f and solve for y: y = (q - e*r/f) / d. We can solve x similarly. This is called backsubstitution.
      // Forward substitution is exactly analogous, and works on a lower triangular matrix.
      //
      // The LU decomposition gives us upper and lower triangular matrices that are amenable to back and forward substitution. We need only
      // arrange the problem to combine the results appropriately. The standard linear equation formula is A·x = b, where A is the
      // coefficient matrix, b is the value vector, and x is a vector containing the unknowns. The goal is to solve for x. With LU
      // decomposition, we have A·x = (L·U)·x = b. Note that (L·U)·x = L·(U·x). We can then let y = U·x and get two equations:
      // U·x = y and L·y = b. These both correspond to the form used above for backsubstitution. So we first solve for y using forward
