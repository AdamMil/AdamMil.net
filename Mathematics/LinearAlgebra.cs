      // 3x + 4y + 5z = 26
      //  x - 2y + 2z = 3
      //
      // then we have coefficient and value matrices, called "a" and "b" here, of:
      // | 2  3  4 |         | 20 |
      // | 3  4  5 |   and   | 26 |
      // | 1 -2  2 |         |  3 |
      //
      // now we iterate over the columns of a. for column j, we:
      //   1. divide the entire row j in both matrices by a_jj
      //   2. for each other row k, then subtract row j times a_kj from row k. this results in a_kj becoming zero
      //   as a result, the column j has a 1 in row j and zeros in all other rows. this matches the form of an identity matrix for that
      //   column
      // after iterating over all columns, the coefficients matrix is changed into an identity matrix and the values matrix contains the
      // solutions. applied to the matrices above, we would do the following in the first iteration:
      //   * divide the first row by a_00 (which is 2), producing:  | 1 3/2 2 |  and  | 10 |
      //   * subtract 3 * row 0 from row 1 and 1 * row 0 from row 2
      //     | 1  3/2  2 |         | 10 |
      //     | 0 -1/2 -1 |   and   | -4 |
      //     | 0 -7/2  0 |         | -7 |
      // the other two iterations produce:
      //   | 1  0  -1 |         | -2 |                | 1  0  0 |   and   | 1 |
      //   | 0  1   2 |   and   |  8 |    and then    | 0  1  0 |   and   | 2 |
      //   | 0  0   7 |         | 21 |                | 0  0  1 |   and   | 3 |
      // so x=1, y=2, and z=3.
      //
      // it's useful to generate the inverse of the coefficient matrix at the same time. this can be done by adding a third matrix of the
      // same size as the coefficients matrix, initially containing an identity matrix, which is treated exactly like the values matrix. as
      // the algorithm progresses, the coefficients matrix will transform into the identity matrix and the identity matrix will transform
      // into the inverse matrix. in fact, since for each corresponding element of the two matrices, one of them will predictably be either
      // a 0 or 1, we don't need a separate matrix but can mutate the coefficient matrix into its inverse rather than mutating it into the
      // identity matrix
      // 
      // now it happens to be the case that this basic form of the algorithm is numerically unstable due to rounding error. therefore the
      // concept of "pivoting" is added to stabilize it. (pivoting is also needed to avoid division by zero in the case of zero entries on
      // the diagonal.) pivoting is essentially finding the best value to divide by in each iteration and swapping rows and columns of the
      // matrix to place that value at a_jj. to avoid messing up the part of the matrix that we've already processed (and converted into
      // identity form), we can choose from any value to the right of and below a_jj (or a_jj itself). swapping rows has no effect on the
      // solution, but swapping columns does, so column swaps have to be reversed at the end. the criteria for choosing the best value to
      // divide by remain undiscovered, but it works well in practice to divide by the coefficient having the largest magnitude. (this
      // makes the behavior dependent on the original scaling of the equations, which may be undesirable in some rare cases, but that is
      // not addressed in this implementation.)

      // r = 0*x + 0*y + f*z = f*z.) With z solved, we move onto y. Because q = 0*x + d*y + e*z = d*y + e*z, we can substitute r/f for z

      // pivot search). the result is not a rowwise permutation of the decomposition, but the decomposition of a rowwise permutation of A.

  /// <summary>Implements singular value decomposition to solve systems of linear equations and provide information about general matrices.
  /// This method is substantially slower than both <see cref="GaussJordan" /> and <see cref="LUDecomposition" />, as well as being
  /// slightly less accurate, but it has a number of powerful features. First, it is able to "solve" overdetermined, underdetermined, and
  /// singular (degenerate) systems. Given an underdetermined system, which will generally have an infinite number of solutions, it can
  /// give one of the solutions as well as provide a description of the solution space that allows you to generate the others.
  /// Given an overdetermined system, which will generally have no solution, it can provide
  /// a "solution" that is as close as possible to solving the equations in a least squares sense. Given a degenerate system, it can
  /// provide an approximate solution as well as allow you to discover what makes the system degenerate. This flexibility allows
  /// <see cref="SVDecomposition"/> to succeed where other methods fail. Singular value decomposition can also be used to obtain a
  /// quantitative description of how near a system is to being singular (i.e. how ill-conditioned it is), to compute the Moore-Penrose
  /// pseudoinverse of a matrix, and to approximate (i.e. lossily compress) a matrix to a specified degree by removing the elements that
