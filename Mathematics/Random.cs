    // the modulo technique is fastest for almost all 32-bit numbers when we don't have a fast way to compute the base-2 logarithm needed
    // for the bitmask technique, and for generators that aren't very slow. the modulo technique is as follows. let's say exclusiveMaximum
    // (max) is 10. then NextUInt32() % max would be biased because 2^32 is not divisible by 10.  we need to reject 2^32 % 10 = 6 values,
    // leaving a usable range of 2^32 - 6 which IS divisible by 10. one way to do this is to reject random values < 6 and then return value
    // % max if it wasn't rejected. the problem with this approach is that it requires performing at least two (slow) modulus operations. so
    // we use a trick, which is to instead take limit = 2^32 - 10 (not -6) and for each value compare n - n%max to that limit. for values 0
    // to max-1, n - n%max is zero. (0-0%10 = 0, 1-1%10 = 0, ..., 9-9%10 = 0.) then for max to max*2-1, n - n%max == max. (10 - 10%10 =
    // 10 - 0 = 10, 11 - 11%10 = 11 - 1 = 10, etc.) thus n - n%max is always a multiple of max. since limit = 2^32 - max, limit is the
    // largest legal value of n - n%max. (beyond that limit, there isn't enough space in the range for another full set of max values.) in
    // our example, limit = 2^32 - 10 but it's not until n = 2^32 - 6 that n - n%max will exceed the limit. when n = 2^32 - 7, n - n%max =
    // 2^32 - 16 and when n = 2^32 - 6, n - n%max = 2^32-6. thus, this approach also excludes six values from the range but requires a
