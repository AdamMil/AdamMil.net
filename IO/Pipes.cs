/// <summary>Implements a full-duplex pipe that can be used by child processes started after the pipe's creation.</summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>A full-duplex pipe is an interprocess communication channel that allows data to be exchanged in both
/// directions. This class implements a simple pipe that is usable by the current process and child processes. The
/// end of the pipe controlled by the current process is called the server end, and is accessed via the
/// <see cref="ServerHandle"/>, while the end of the pipe controlled by a child process is called the client end, and
/// is accessed via the <see cref="ClientHandle"/>. The client handle value is typically passed to the child process
/// on its command line.
/// </para>
/// <para>To convert a handle into a <see cref="Stream"/>, use a <see cref="FileStream"/>. First create a
/// <see cref="SafeFileHandle"/>, passing false so that the pipe handle is not owned by the
/// <see cref="SafeFileHandle"/>, and then pass it to the <see cref="FileStream(SafeFileHandle,FileAccess)"/>
/// constructor.
/// </para>
/// <para>If both ends of the pipe are open, reading will block until the other end has written data, and if the pipe's
/// buffer is full, writing will block until the other end has read the data that's already been written. Also note
/// that the <see cref="FileStream"/> buffers output, so data written to the <see cref="FileStream"/> will not actually
/// be sent through the pipe until its buffer is full or <see cref="Stream.Flush"/> is called.
/// If the pipe has been closed at one end, reading from the other will not block, and writing to it will fail.
/// </para>
/// <para>Finally, note that the pipe will be closed when the <see cref="InheritablePipe"/> object is destroyed, so
/// a reference must be kept to it until both sides are finished.
/// </para>
