// this is a software transactional memory (STM) system based on the ideas (particularly OSTM) laid out in the paper "Concurrent
// programming without locks" [Fraser and Harris, 2007]. the system should be lock-free, meaning that it is free from deadlock
// and livelock, and a transaction should be guaranteed to eventually commit if it is retried enough times. the system also
// incorporates nested transactions. finally, the system integrates with the .NET System.Transactions framework, although while
// doing so, lock-freedom must be suspended at a certain point to match the System.Transactions model, which doesn't really
// support obstruction clearing.
//
// the basic ideas come from that papers, but unfortunately it doesn't give complete a implementation description. for instance,
// the paper handwaves away nested transactions and assumes single-phase commit. additionally, it's not very amenable to the
// inclusion of fancy features from the Haskell STM or to integration with System.Transactions, so i've modified it somewhat
//
// the system allows the possibility that a transaction can read inconsistent state. this is a common problem with STM
// implementations, and in a system like this one, where transactions can help each other commit, it seems difficult to fix
// without adverse effects on either performance or transaction commit rate. a transaction that has read inconsistent state would
// eventually abort itself, but it's possible for the inconsistent state to cause unpredictable behavior if the transaction is
// not written with that possibility in mind. to address this, i've done the following:
// * added a way to manually check consistency during a transaction, to establish that the transaction has been consistent so far
// * added an option to automatically check consistency after each variable is opened. this eliminates the possibility of viewing
//   inconsistent state, at the cost of a substantial performance penalty
// * made STM.Retry() use a consistency check to see if an exception thrown from the transaction may have been caused by
//   inconsistency. if so, the transaction is retried, and if not, the exception is propagated

// TODO: add spin waits to various loops when we upgrade to .NET 4 (e.g. TryUpdateStatus)?
// TODO: consider using GCHandles (i.e. weak references) in the transaction log so that we don't hold onto things that aren't used anymore
// (but check the performance first)
// TODO: consider using CallContext instead of (or in addition to) thread-local storage so that the transaction will flow across
// asynchronous calls, etc

  /// <para>As an example, imagine a sorted linked list <c>A -> B -> D -> E</c>. If C is inserted, then B will need to be

  /// B) for read access. However, the insertion and the search are not actually in conflict. Releasing variables to avoid this
  /// kind of false conflict can greatly increase scalability. The solution is the following:
  /// <list type="bullet">
  ///   <item><description>A transaction searching for an item need only keep the node currently being checked open for reading.</description></item>
  ///   <item><description>A transaction inserting an item needs to keep the node being modified open for writing and the
  ///   previous node open for reading. (While searching for the place to insert the item, it should keep the current and
  ///   previous nodes open for reading.)
  ///   </description></item>
  ///   <item><description>A transaction removing an item needs to have both the node being removed and the previous node open
  ///   for writing, but can release items before that.
  ///   </description></item>
  /// </list>
  /// This key concept in determining whether two operations really conflict is linearizability. Note that under this scheme, a
  /// search may begin for C, and concurrently, C may be inserted into the list. If the insert method returns before the search
  /// method, the search may report that nothing was found, despite C existing when the search returned! Graphically, the
  /// overlapping operations may look like this:
  /// <code>
  /// [Insert(C).............]
  /// .....[Search(C)..............]:false
  /// </code>
  /// However, this behavior is not incorrect. An operation is atomic if, over the course of its execution, there is a point when
  /// it appears to complete instantaneously, and crucially, that point does not have to be at the end of the operation. Consider
  /// the call sequence again, with possible linearization points (i.e. points when the operations appear to complete atomically)
  /// represented using pipe characters:
  /// <code>
  /// [Insert(C)...........|.]
  /// .....[Search(C).|............]:false
  /// </code>
  /// Now you can see that indeed the search could have linearized (i.e. completed) before the insertion. Even if the search did
  /// not in fact complete first, that is irrelevant. All that matters is that it is possible to place linearization points such
  /// that the results would be valid. More formally, a history -- a series of operation invocations and responses -- is
  /// sequential if the corresponding response for each invocation comes immediately after it in the history, and a history is
  /// linearizable if it can be reordered to form a sequential history, and that history is valid according to the definitions of
  /// the operations, and any response which preceded an invocation in the original history still precedes it in the reordered
  /// history. The history for the above sequence is: <c>Insert(C), Search(C), Insert returns, Search returns false</c>. It is
  /// possible to reorder this history into a linearization: <c>Search(C), Search returns false, Insert(C), Insert returns</c>,
  /// and therefore it is a valid result. (Note that <c>Insert(C), Insert returns, Search(C), Search returns false</c> is another
  /// possible serialization, but is not valid according to the definition of the operations, so it is not a linearization.)
  /// Because there exists at least one linearization of the history, the history is transactionally valid. This process of
  /// reordering histories is equivalent to the process of choosing linearization points in a graphical representation of the
  /// overlapping operations.
  /// </para>
  /// <para>
  /// The linearizability of the operations is what must be maintained when releasing variables as an optimization, not the exact
  /// linearization points. A data structure remains linearizable as long as all valid histories can be linearized. For a given
  /// structure, this is difficult to prove, but for our sorted linked list example, we can take an informal approach. First
  /// consider what is needed for a search. For a search to not find an item, all that matters is that there was a point during
  /// the search at which the item didn't exist. (It can be considered to have linearized at that point.) Only if the item
  /// existed for the entire time must the search return it, so what we have to show is that if the item exists the entire time,
  /// then the search will find it. The search algorithm would only fail to find it if it's prevented from reaching the item, and
  /// as normally written that would only happen if the current node is changed, preventing the search from getting to the next
  /// item. To prevent this, it suffices to keep the current node open, because changing a node requires modifying it. Note that
  /// search that occurs during insertion and removal (to find the insertion point or node to remove) must keep the previous node
  /// open as well, because insertion cannot have the insertion point disappear after it's found, and removal must be able to
  /// modify the previous node.
  /// </para>
  /// <para>Next, consider what is needed for an insertion to succeed. The nodes before one being inserted (i.e. B
  /// in A -> B -> D when inserting C) must not be removed or modified, and the node after (i.e. D) must not be deleted.
  /// Protecting B from deletion is accomplished by keeping A open. Protecting B from modification and D from removal are
  /// accomplished by keeping B open, so again only two nodes need to be kept open. Finally, consider what is necessary for
  /// removal to succeed. The node being removed and/or the previous node must be modified, and the subsequent node must not be
  /// removed, and nothing can be inserted immediately after the previous node or the node to be removed. Opening both the node
  /// to remove and the previous node ensures both of these conditions. If the next node was removed or something was inserted
  /// after the node being removed, it would require the modification of the node being removed, which is prevented by it being
  /// kept open. If something was to be inserted after the previous node, the previous node would need to be modified, and
  /// keeping it open prevents that. Therefore, all three operations can be supported by keeping only two nodes open at a time.
  /// </para>
  /// <para>Note that this analysis is only valid for a sorted structure. In a sorted linked list, seeing B -> D is enough to
  /// conclude that C does not exist, but in a regular linked list, or an array, C could be inserted anywhere. Consider a search
  /// for C in the following array: <c>J, B, F, C</c>, and the following history:
  /// <code>
  /// [Search(C).0..............1............2..............3.........]:false
  /// ..............[Set(0,C)]..................[Set(3,N)]
  /// </code>
  /// The item C exists the entire time, but a search that only keeps a small window open can miss it and report that it doesn't
  /// exist. More formally, this history is not linearizable: <c>Search(C), Set(0,C), Set(0,C) returns, Set(3,N), Set(3,N)
  /// returns, Search(C) returns false</c>. It can be serialized: <c>Search(C), Search(C) returns false, Set(0,C), Set(0,C)
  /// returns, Set(3,N), Set(3,N) returns</c>, however this is not valid because Search(C) should have returned true in this
  /// history. Therefore, a search over an unordered structure must be capable of detecting changes that insert the searched-for
  /// item prior to current item that the search is examining. In other words, a search that doesn't find an item in an
  /// unordered structure must check the consistency of every item when it commits. But if the search finds the item, it can then
