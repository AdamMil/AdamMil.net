// decent code in both debug and release builds? (or, if it's C# doing the optimizing, we could turn on optimizations for debug

/// <summary>Implements a Bloom filter, which is a space-efficient probabilistic set that supports two operations. You can add
/// an item to the set using <see cref="Add"/>, and you can query whether an item might have been added to the set using
/// <see cref="PossiblyContains"/>. False positives are possible, so that <see cref="PossiblyContains"/> may return true for an
/// item that was never added, but false negatives are not possible, so if <see cref="PossiblyContains"/> returns false, then the
/// item definitely was not added. It is not possible to remove items from the set or to count or enumerate the items within the
/// set.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Bloom filters are most efficient when the set of keys that will be added is very sparse with respect to the set of possible
/// keys, and the approximate number of items that will be added is known in advance. At a
/// 0.1% false positive rate, the filter uses about 14.4 bits per expected item, depending on the number of hash functions.
/// With an optimal number of hash functions, the number of bits per expected item equals <c>-ln(p) / ln(2)^2</c> where p is the
/// probabity of false positives. This means that Bloom filters only save space when the density of keys is less than
/// <c>-ln(2)^2 / ln(p)</c> (about 7% -- 1/14.4 -- for a 0.1% false positive rate).
/// So if the filter will be used with 1000 randomly selected nonnegative integers (a density of about 0.00005%), then it is an
/// efficient data structure. But if it will be used with 1000 integers from the restricted range of 0 to 4999 (a density of
/// 20%), then a Bloom filter is a very poor choice.
/// <para>A better choice would simply be a bit array containing 5000 bits, with a single bit representing each integer from 0 to
/// 4999. This uses only 1 bit per item (5 bits per expected item), has no false positives, allows more items to be stored,
/// allows the items in the set to be enumerated and counted, and is much faster. In particular, note that all non-negative
/// integers (approximately 2.15 billion of them) can be stored in a bit array 256MB in size, which has all the benefits
/// mentioned above, while a 256MB Bloom filter can hold less than 150 million integers at a 0.1% false positive rate. Where
/// Bloom filters really shine are with very large keys spaces, like the set of possible URL strings.
/// </para>
/// <para>Bloom filters have a size that is fixed when they are created. As more items are added to the set, the false positive
/// rate increases. It is possible to tune the size of the Bloom filter to achieve an expected false positive rate for a given
/// number of items. The <see cref="BloomFilter{T}(int,float)"/> constructor can assist with this.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The Bloom filter requires an <see cref="IMultiHashProvider{T}"/> to operate. By default it uses
/// <see cref="MultiHashProvider{T}"/>, which works well for all integer types, <see cref="string"/>, <see cref="Decimal"/>,
/// <see cref="Single"/>, <see cref="Double"/>, <see cref="Char"/>, <see cref="DateTime"/>, and <see cref="Guid"/> as well as
/// nullable versions of those. For other types, it uses a generic hash algorithm that is only suitable up to a certain number of
/// items that depends on the false positive rate. For 0.025% false positives, it is usually suitable up to about 1 million
/// items, depending on the quality of the .NET <see cref="object.GetHashCode"/> implementation. At 0.25% false positives, it is
/// usually suitable up to about 10 million items. Beyond that, you may need to create your own hash provider.
